Welcome to Habeetat!
This note will guide you to step-by-step to use Habeetat and guide your design to more bee and other pollinators friendly. The steps consist of the pre-installment for the software you need to have and the using inside the Habeetat framework with you case site. 

Pre-installment tool

0.1. This framwework is a Rhinoceros-grasshopper-based computational framework. Before you download the Habeetat script in github, you must have Rhinoceros 6 or 7 and grasshopper installed in your computer. 
0.2. Habeetat tool is a combination of Human UI plug-in Grasshopper, which you need to download and have it installed in Grasshopper.

Habeetat tool tutorial

1. Download all the file in Habeetat from the option 'Code', including .3dm, .gh, .txt, and .gif

2. Open TRY.3dm file in Rhinoceros program

3. Open Grasshopper in Rhinoceros, and open Habeetat.gh in Grasshopper

4. Step 1, SITE. 
Click left mouse button on the site in Rhiceros and set one curve on Site. Set the information regarding existing habitat, trees and condition at the section below Site

5. Step 2, SITE FRAMING. 
Before you cluster the site, you have an option to create a green hedge around your site. In this section, you can give a green hedge between highway and residental area. On top of creating hedges, in this step you are mainly having option to create the preferences cluster of neighborhood including street network. Clustering can be done in multiple layer under the option of 'CREATE CLUSTER'. Aside of that you can also re-arrange the frame position under the option 'Arrange Cluster Layout'. Remember that you can always check the area size by click into 'True' on the 'AREA' option.

6. Step 3. LAND USE.
This step provides the arrangement between build area and different type of natural habitat application. First option will ask you how many portion you want to share between covered ground of building and nature. You can divide through the number sliders, the bigger the number, the bigger you share your design with nature. Then, you will be asked on the below section to decide how many you want to provide between vegetated garden, park/grassland and wilderness area/urban woodland This section also provides number sliders to arrange the plotting and layout of the applied green habitat on the landscape. 

7. Step 4. BUILDING
Before you set the building features, make sure to click 'True' to show the 3D model. The first step to choose the feature is to define how many type of building you want to add (in the example I chosed 2 types). Then you can arrange the height of each type of building along with the ground cover you apply. Afterwards, you can choose either you want to appply green roof or not by clicking 'True' or 'False' beside the section title. If you choose to apply, you can arrange the type of green roof you want apply, target condition and choose the strategy. Further, there will be a section where you can checklist type of plantations you want to apply on your landscape and green rood garden. The next section will be you can arrange if you want to add trees on your green roof. 

8. Step 5. ASSESSMENT
After you have done applying the features in the previous step, its time to see the impact. In this step, the assessment consists of a displayed window on the tool as a data visualization that representa 'Habitat Unit' assessment, 'Pollinators invited', 'Effect towards humans health and well-being' and 'Environmental impact'. To be able show this data visualization, click the toggle beside 'ASSESSMENT'. Another visualization can be seen directly on 3D model will be presented o 'Biophilia', 'Social Connectivity', 'Ecological Connectivity' and 'Safe Migratory'. To show each category, you will need to click 'True' on the toggle beside each category title. If you want to avoid the visualization looks collided to each other surface during the assessment, you can turn off to 'False' on the toggle beside 'SHOW 3D BUILDING' and 'LAND USE'.

Finally, if you feel not really satisfied with the result, you can always modify the features on the previous steps.
